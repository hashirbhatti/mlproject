# Student Math Score Prediction

Welcome to the Student Math Score Prediction project! This end-to-end machine learning project is designed to predict student math scores based on various input features. What sets this project apart is its modular architecture and the inclusion of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The pipeline covers key components of the machine learning lifecycle, including Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Model Training, Model Evaluation, and Model Deployment.




## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed a machine-learning model that predicts student math scores. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various features such as gender, lunch_type, parental_level_of_education and others which are used to make predictions about student performance.

The project's modular architecture allows you to work on specific components independently, making it easier to maintain and extend. The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the model, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and reliable.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modular components:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Responsible for fetching and storing the dataset. This component ensures that the data is up-to-date and readily available for analysis and model training.

2. **Data Transformation:** Handles data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data splitting. This module ensures that the data is in the right format for training the machine learning model.

3. **Model Trainer:** Contains the machine learning model and training code. It takes preprocessed data, trains the model, and saves it for evaluation and deployment.

Additionally, I've created a simple Flask web application that allows users to interact with the model through a user-friendly interface. This frontend is designed using simple HTML forms and inline CSS for an intuitive user experience.
